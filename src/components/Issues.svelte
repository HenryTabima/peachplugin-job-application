  <h2>Here a couple of issues I found</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The Plugin logs into the browser console (this could be a security issue), and is unconfotable when working as developer.</li>
    <li>Once you take your widget out of the screen by the left side, is near to impossible to get it back</li>
    <li>I told to my best friend to try the plugin, and he was getting NaN as peach count</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="img-container">
    <img alt="Logs in console" src="logs.JPG" width=400/>
    <img alt="NaN counter" src="NaN.jpg" widt=300 height=100/>
  </div>
  <p>PD: I have work with firebase before.</p>

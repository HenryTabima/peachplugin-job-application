      My job application for PeachPlugin
    </h1>
  </header>

  <p>Hello! I'm <b>HENRY TABIMA GIRALDO</b>. I’m a Mechatronic engineer and Full-stack Developer with knowledge in data science. I’ve worked implementing software for energy management systems and as a Mentor and technical support engineer for students at Microverse, a remote school for software development. I’m currently looking for a job as a remote full-stack or front-end developer that will put my engineering skills to work.</p>
  <p><b>I've tried by myself the plugin and I really love it!</b> It feels like a game, and watching the peaches going up while doing what I already do is amazing. for sure, this is something I would love work in.</p>
  <p>I’m passionate about problem-solving and coding in JavaScript and think I could be a great addition to your development team. I’d like to talk and learn more about the PeachPlugin goals and how I could contribute.</p>
